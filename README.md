# Reselling101OnStockX
## Purpose
<p>As a reseller myself, I have experienced both the low and high of reselling sneakers. I have created a personal project to showcase what I have 
learned and hopefully give insight to others that are aspiring to get started. It should be noted that my economic knowledge is very limited as 
I only took one economic course, ECON 251, at Purdue University. Most information is through personal research and my experience reselling. 
  Here is my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unsaturatedgoods/">reselling Instagram account</a></p>
## Program
* Utilized JSoup's library to complete the Web Scraping process. For those interested in this external library, vist their site <a href="https://jsoup.org/">here</a>.
* Used StockX's database to extract the prices and statistics of shoes to help make users make the educated decision on whether or not to sell their shoe.
* Wrote an in-depth paper that explores the world of reselling!
