# Reselling101OnStockX
## Purpose
<p>As a reseller myself, I have experienced both the low and high of reselling sneakers. I have created a personal project to showcase what I have 
learned and hopefully give insight to others that are aspiring to get started. It should be noted that my economic knowledge is very limited as 
I only took one economic course, ECON 251, at Purdue University. Most information is through personal research and my experience reselling. 
Here is my [reselling Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/unsaturatedgoods/) for those interested as well as my personal website!</p>
