# Reselling 101 On StockX
## Purpose
As a reseller myself, I have experienced both the low and high of reselling sneakers. I have created a personal project to showcase what I have 
learned and hopefully give insight to others that are aspiring to get started. It should be noted that my economic knowledge is very limited as 
I only took one economic course, ECON 25100 - Microeconomics, at Purdue University. Most information is through personal research and my experience reselling. 
  Here is my [reselling Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/unsaturatedgoods/) for those interested!
## Program
* Utilized JSoup's library to complete the Web Scraping process. For those interested in this external library, vist their site [here](https://jsoup.org/).
* Used StockX's database to extract the prices and statistics of shoes to help make users make the educated decision on whether or not to sell their shoe.
* Wrote an <a href="/pdfs/Reselling 101 on StockX.pdf">in-depth paper</a> that explores the world of reselling!
